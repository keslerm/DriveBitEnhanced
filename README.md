# Drive Bit Enhanced
This is a clone of the android app DriveBit which changes functionality a little bit so that instead of a timer you start and stop you can easily flag the last X minutes as Driving. This works better for me as I tend to completely forget to start the timer and adjusting the time afterwards is more work than just clicking a button saying "Last 15 minutes".

You will need to setup your own API keys if you build this from source within FitBit and rename the example.properties to config.properties located in the assets directory.
